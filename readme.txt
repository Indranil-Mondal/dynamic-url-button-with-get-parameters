A custom Elementor widget for creating buttons with dynamic GET parameters and style customization.

== Description ==

This is a simple plugin that Adds a \"Custom Button\" Widget in the Elementor Editor\'s left panel that allows the user to construct a URL with the following parts :
The Base URL, The GET Parameters, and the Get parameters Value. You can add as many GET Parameters as you want and the Value will be dynamic as per the post.

Example:
www.example.com/checkout?paramater-one=postid&parameter-two=postname
